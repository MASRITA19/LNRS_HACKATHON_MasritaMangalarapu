## Introduction
Handwritten text recognition is a challenging task in the field of computer vision and machine learning. This project aims to provide a simple and efficient solution for recognizing handwritten text in images using the Tesseract-OCR engine.

## Dependencies
The project depends on the following libraries:

- **Python 3.x**: The project is written in Python 3.x and requires a compatible version to run.
- **OpenCV**: OpenCV is used for image processing and manipulation.
- **Tesseract-OCR**: Tesseract-OCR is used for recognizing handwritten text in images.
- **Pillow**: Pillow is used for image processing and manipulation.

## Usage
To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using the command:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>

   Handwritten-Text-Recognition/
│
├── main.py               # The main script that runs the project
├── requirements.txt       # The file that lists the dependencies required to run the project
├── images/                # The folder that contains the images used for testing the project
└── README.md              # The file that contains information about the project

# How it Works
The project works as follows:

1. The user runs the project using the command `python main.py`.
2. The project reads the images from the `images/` folder.
3. The project uses OpenCV to preprocess the images.
4. The project uses Tesseract-OCR to recognize the handwritten text in the images.
5. The project prints the recognized text to the console.
